This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution modified for TP-Link WR1043ND.

Please use "make menuconfig" to configure your appreciated
configuration for the toolchain and firmware.

You need to have installed gcc, binutils, patch, bzip2, flex,
make, gettext, pkg-config, unzip, libz-dev and libc headers.

Run "./scripts/feeds update" to get the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default respectively
and "./scripts/feeds install" to install symlinks into "package/feeds/*".

Use "make menuconfig" to configure your image.

Simply running "make" will build your firmware.
It will download all sources, build the cross-compile toolchain, 
the kernel and all choosen applications.

You can use "scripts/flashing/flash.sh" for remotely updating your embedded
system via tftp.

The OpenWrt system is documented in docs/. You will need a LaTeX distribution
and the tex4ht package to build the documentation. Type "make -C docs/" to build it.

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.

The OpenWRT firmware is in the bin/ar71xx/ directory and the backup files including 
restoring back to factory is in TL-WR1043ND_Backup_Files/ directory.

To use the scripts make sure the build directory path is set correctly in the script.
You need JRE installed to run the scripts.
